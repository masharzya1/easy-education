API Introduction
The RupantorPay Payment Gateway enables merchants to receive payments from customers by temporarily redirecting them to RupantorPay.com. The gateway connects multiple payment terminals including card systems, mobile financial systems, and local/international wallets. After payment completion, customers are returned to the merchant's site, and the merchant receives payment notification with transaction details.
