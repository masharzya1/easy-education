## Introduction to ZiniPay

ZiniPay is a simple and secure payment automation tool designed to use personal accounts as a payment gateway, allowing you to accept payments from customers through your website. This documentation provides a complete overview of how ZiniPay works and how you can integrate the ZiniPay API into your website.

### API Introduction

ZiniPay Payment Gateway enables Merchants to receive money from their customers by temporarily redirecting them to ZiNiPay.com. The gateway connects multiple payment terminals including card systems, mobile financial systems, and local and international wallets. After the payment is complete, the customer is returned to the merchant's site, and seconds later the Merchant receives notification about the payment along with the details of the transaction.

### API Operation

REST APIs are supported in two environments. Use the Sandbox environment for testing purposes, then move to the live environment for production processing. When testing, generate an order URL with your test credentials to make calls to the Sandbox URIs. When you're set to go live, use the live credentials assigned to your new signature key to generate a live order URL to be used with the live URIs. Your server must support the cURL system.

Live API End Point (For Create Payment URL):

`https://api.zinipay.com/v1/payment/create`

### Create Payment Examples

The following examples show how to create a payment request with the ZiniPay API in various programming languages.

PHPPHP GuzzleJavaScript NodePythonGo

```
<?php

$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
  CURLOPT_URL => 'https://api.zinipay.com/v1/payment/create',
  CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
  CURLOPT_ENCODING => '',
  CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 0,

  CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS =>'{"redirect_url":"yourdomain.com/success","cancel_url":"yourdomain.com/cancel","webhook_url":"yourdomain.com/webhook","metadata":{"phone":"016****"},"amount":"10"}',
  CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
   'zini-api-key': 'YOUR_BRAND_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
  ),
));

$response = curl_exec($curl);

curl_close($curl);
echo $response;

?>
```

### Response Example

```

```
<?php
// Verify Payment Example
$apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

// Initialize cURL session
$ch = curl_init();

// Transaction ID received from success URL
$invoiceId = $_GET['invoiceId'];

// Prepare data for API request
$data = [\
    'invoiceId' => $invoiceId,\
    'apiKey' => $apiKey\
];

// Configure cURL request
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zinipay.com/v1/payment/verify');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));
