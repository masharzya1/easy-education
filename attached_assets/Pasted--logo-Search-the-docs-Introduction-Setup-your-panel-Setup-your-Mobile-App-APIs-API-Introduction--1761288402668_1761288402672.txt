API Introduction
The RupantorPay Payment Gateway enables merchants to receive payments from customers by temporarily redirecting them to RupantorPay.com. The gateway connects multiple payment terminals including card systems, mobile financial systems, and local/international wallets. After payment completion, customers are returned to the merchant's site, and the merchant receives payment notification with transaction details.

Note: This document is intended for technical personnel supporting merchant websites. Working knowledge of HTML forms or cURL is required.
API Operation

Sandbox: For testing purposes (use test credentials)
Live: For production processing (use live credentials)
POST GET Create Payment URL
https://payment.rupantorpay.com/api/payment/checkout

POST GET Verify Payment
