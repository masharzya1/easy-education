# Easy Education - Free Online Courses Platform

### Overview
Easy Education is a React-based Progressive Web App (PWA) providing a comprehensive platform for free online courses. It includes features for course management, user authentication, announcements, news, payment tracking, and robust assessment tools like course-level exams and student analytics. The platform aims to offer a user-friendly and effective educational experience.

### User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear communication on proposed changes. Please ask before making major architectural changes or significant modifications to existing features. I appreciate detailed explanations for complex implementations.

### System Architecture
The platform is built using React 18.2.0 with Vite, styled with TailwindCSS and Radix UI. Firebase provides authentication (Google OAuth included) and Firestore database services. Image uploads are handled by the imgbb.com API. React Router DOM manages routing, and state is managed with React Context API. It functions as a PWA with service worker support for offline capabilities.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Responsive design optimized for mobile.
- Theme-aware elements (Dark/Light mode) and a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Support for Bangla language and Bangladeshi Taka (à§³) currency.
- Consistent UI components like `CourseCard` across the platform.
